# scRNAseq-PBMC-analysis
# Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of PBMC (3k)

## Overview
This project performs single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on PBMC dataset using Scanpy.

The workflow includes:

- Data loading (external dataset)
- Quality control
- Doublet detection (Scrublet)
- Normalization
- Highly variable gene selection
- PCA
- Clustering (Leiden)
- UMAP visualization
- Marker gene identification

## Dataset
PBMC 3k dataset from 10x Genomics.

## Tools
- Python
- Scanpy
- Scrublet

## Output
The analysis identifies immune cell populations and visualizes cellular heterogeneity.
